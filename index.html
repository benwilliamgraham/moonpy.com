          Moonpy is a Python distribution that allows for rapid code development
          without sacrificing performance. By drastically increasing the
          performance of Python, Moonpy enables companies to reduce
          time-to-market, save on developer expenses, and reduce compute
          resources while opening up new opportunities in AI, web development,
          and edge computing.

        <h1>Why Moonpy?</h1>
        <div class="reason card">
          <img src="images/productivity.png" />
          <h2>Increase productivity</h2>
          Get the full benefit of developing with Python without any of the
          speed and memory constraints that come with it
        </div>

        <div class="reason card">
          <img src="images/edge.png" />
          <h2>Compute at the edge</h2>
          Open up new doors for localized artificial intelligence, data science,
          and IoT devices
        </div>

        <div class="reason card">
          <img src="images/resources.png" />
          <h2>Save on resources</h2>
          Cut costs on both hardware and electricity without changing your
          codebase
        </div>

        <p>
          These new features make Moonpy a great choice for developers and
          companies alike. Using Moonpy dramatically reduces the amount of time
          and work that goes into the development of an application, allowing
          developers to focus on what matters in a project without having to
          worry about performance limitations. No longer will companies be
          forced to choose between a costly development and a costly production;
          with Moonpy they can get the full benefit of developing with Python
          without any of the speed and memory constraints that come with it.
          Furthermore, software implemented in Python will now require less
          processing power, cutting costs on both hardware and electricity
          without requiring any changes to the codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moonpy also opens up many new opportunities to use the Python
          programming language. Because of its increased speed and lower memory
          overhead, Python can now be used efficiently for many small embedded
          systems such as those in IoT and other real-time computing devices.
          Python code can also be converted to an efficient WebAssembly binary
          that can be run in the browser, often with far greater performance
          than JavaScript or PHP. These abilities open up the opportunity to
          finally bring the wonders of Python and its incredible ecosystem to
          the world of web development and edge computing.
